## About The Project

Mango is a fully modular build tool for theme development on the Shopify platform. 
This tool aims to fill the void where there are no ready to go & fully featured tooling out there that isn't deprecated or has a lot of setup to do first.

Use either SASS or PostCSS when using our recommended settings.

Mango also includes it's own live reload - based on a Web Socket implementation, so we know exactly when to refresh the browser.

Mango aims to provide you with the strongest tooling to build high-level, production ready, backwards browser compatible code - so you don't need to worry about using Promises on that enterprise client, because IE doesn't support them. 

### Built With
Mango is build with Pure NodeJS sprinkled with a little bit of Commander and cross-spawn to handle different computer environments and nothing else - no tasks runners; nothing else.
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Commander](https://tj.github.io/commander.js/)
* [Cross-Spawn](https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn)


## Getting Started

Mango is easy to get started with, although it depends on Themekit - why reinvent the wheel?

### Prerequisites

* **Shopify ThemeKit**
Make sure you have Shopifys Themekit installed, follow these directions:
https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit

* **npm**
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```


### Installation

1. Super easy, install the @shopackify/mango package in your dev environment and away you go.
2.  ```sh
    npm install @shopackify/mango -g
    ```

## Usage

### Caveats
* We rely on both `./shop/dist` & `./shop/src` folders for this to work, ThemeKit watches the `./shop/dist` folder for changes.
* We expect you to follow our folder structure listed below.
### What to expect
Using the recommended config `mango init -r` or `mango init --recommended`
It will layout the directory structure that mango uses.

**PLEASE NOTE: WE DO NOT SUPPORT LIQUID IN SASS/CSS AND OR JS FILES, THESE WILL NOT BE COMPILED AND WILL THROW ERRORS**
**SHOPIFY HAS DISCONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THESE FILES, PLEASE STORE ALL NEEDED LIQUID VARS IN A SNIPPET FOR CSS VARS OR JSON OBJECT**

* All **VENDOR** - files need to be placed into the vendor folder, this will not be minified/transpiled or polyfilled
  - Outputs as vendor.min.js

* All **JS** - files should be placed in the modules folder, or if you want to use your own js structure that's fine as well
  These need to be imported in the top level .js file for webpack to access
  ``` javascript
  app.js

  import './modules/my-module';
  ```
  - Outputs as theme.min.js

* All **SCSS/CSS** - files should be placed in the styles folder, you should probably split these up into whatever folder structure
  you like if you haven't done so already and imported into a `style.scss` file or `styles.css` file.
  This master file should be imported in our top level .js file.
  ```javascript
  app.js

  import '../styles/main.scss';
  import './modules/my-js-module';
  ```
  - Outputs as theme.min.css
### Directory Structure
Make sure your directory structure follows this if you're not starting from scratch:
A few notes, you can use whatever structure you like for `./shop/src/dev/js/modules` rename or nest more folders.
as long as you're importing them into a top-level .js file

This is the same for the styles directory, as long as they're imported into a top-level file then imported
into the top-level .js file.

```

**Mango Build**
`mango build` - Will build the dist folder based on your src folder, this is useful if you don't like storing your dist
folder in your repo, or your current working directory is just src. 

**Mango Download**
`mango download` - Will download the currently defined theme in your `config.yml` file. See [here](https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit/configuration-reference) for more information about `config.yml` 

**Mango Init**
`mango init` - Will initialize the project directory with the right directory structure.
It takes in an option flag `-r` or `--recommended` this is the default, which sets up all the config files for you and `-s` or `--standard` which provides the config files, but they're not populated.

**Mango Convert**
`mango convert` - Will convert the currently downloaded theme to a working directory, you should usually run this command after directory initialization. Everything gets shuffled into the dev directory, with respective folder naming.

**Mango Watch**
`mango watch` - Will start watching our `src` directory with custom watchers, but makes Themekit watch our `dist` directory. Any changes in the `src` directory will be reflected/compiled in the respective place in `dist`.
We will also write a script to `./layout/theme.liquid` which contains a live-reload script at the bottom before `</body>`. Feel free to delete
this if you don't want live reload, or you don't want it in your live production build.

**Mango Locales**
`mango locales` - Will look for `./src/dev/locales.config.json`, check `./src/locales/` for existing localization, and performs a deep merge of these settings. If path is already set in your locales folder, it will not override it.
Only the designated default locale will receive the initial translations. The rest will receive blanks to be set from admin.
This is so the shopify translation system will detect missing translations.

Below is an example schema of `./src/dev/locales.config.json`:
```
{
  "locales": ["en.default", "ja"],
  "translations": {
    "404": {
      "general": {
        "title": "Page not found"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## About The Project

Shopackify is a fully modular build tool for theme development on the Shopify platform. 
This tool aims to fill the void where there are no ready to go & fully featured tooling out there that isn't deprecated or has a lot of setup to do first.

Use either SASS or PostCSS when using our recommended settings.

Shopackify also includes it's own live reload - based on a Web Socket implementation, so we know exactly when to refresh the browser.

Shopackify aims to provide you with the strongest tooling to build high-level, production ready, backwards browser compatible code - so you don't need to worry about using Promises on that enterprise client, because IE doesn't support them. 

### Built With
Shopackify is build with Pure NodeJS sprinkled with a little bit of Commander and cross-spawn to handle different computer environments and nothing else - no tasks runners; nothing else.
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Commander](https://tj.github.io/commander.js/)
* [Cross-Spawn](https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Shopackify is easy to get started with, although it depends on Themekit - why reinvent the wheel?

### Prerequisites

* **Shopify ThemeKit**
Make sure you have Shopifys Themekit installed, follow these directions:
https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit

* **npm**
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```


### Installation

1. Super easy, install the @shopackify/shopackify package in your dev environment and away you go.
2.  `npm install @shopackify/shopackify`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

**Shopackify Download**
`npx shopackify download` - Will download the currently defined theme in your `config.yml` file. See [here](https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit/configuration-reference) for more information about `config.yml` 

**Shopackify Init**
`npx shopackify init` - Will initialize the project directory with the right directory structure.
It takes in an option flag `-r` or `--recommended` this is the default, which sets up all the config files for you and `-s` or `--standard` which provides the config files, but they're not populated.

**Shopackify Convert**
`npx shopackify convert` - Will convert the currently downloaded theme to a working directory, you should usually run this command after directory initialization. Everything gets shuffled into the dev directory, with respective folder naming.

**Shopackify Watch**
`npx shopackify watch` - Will start watching our `src` directory with custom watchers, but makes Themekit watch our `dist` directory. Any changes in the `src` directory will be reflected/compiled in the respective place in `dist`.
